### ü§î Who Am I!?

I am a passionate and communicative software developer. I learned a little about many languages and tools, but I had more experience in Java with Spring Boot. I am always studying and willing to help others with what I've learned.

I have always been energetic and eager to collaborate with people in different projects and I have acquired multidisciplinary experiences from these various activities that I have participated in. I have good leadership skills, a sense of urgency and priority, I can translate technical requirements for lay customers on the subject and I focus on the solution rather than the problem.

I seek constant improvement in various professional and personal aspects. I also always aim to be a collaborative, pleasant and motivating presence for everyone. This helped me develop social and emotional skills relevant to teamwork.

I'm objective, adaptable, good-natured and nerdy ;)
